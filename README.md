# What-Cloud

A light, single server file-sharing cloud written in rust and vue


Inspired by Nextcloud and Google Drive, I wanted to build my own Cloud file-storage solution. 
It is designed to run on a single instance and use few resources and be easy to install.

Software used in this project:
- Rust + rocket.rs
- Own written Rust zip-stream library
- Vue3 and Typescript
- Sqlite
